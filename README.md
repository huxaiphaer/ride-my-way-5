## Ride My Way.
Ride-my App is a carpooling application that provides drivers with the ability to create ride offers and passengers to join available ride offers.

A working application can be found here [here](https://ride-my-way-react-huxy.herokuapp.com/).

#### How it Works.

Both Passengers and Drivers interact on the same platform to create rides and as well as requesting them. Anyone can be a passenger
or a driver on Ride My Way App.
